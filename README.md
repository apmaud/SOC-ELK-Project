# SOC-ELK-Project

## Objective

The SOC Lab project was designed to build a functional Security Operations Center (SOC) environment using real-world security tools and multiple interconnected machines. The lab focused on the deployment and configuration of Elastic and Kibana for log ingestion, monitoring, and alerting, as well as integrating alerts with the osTicket ticketing system to support incident tracking and analyst workflows.   
An attacker system was introduced to generate realistic security events, allowing alerts to be investigated and escalated by a simulated SOC analyst. This project provided hands-on experience with a production-style SOC stack and reinforced practical understanding of threat detection, alert handling, and the end-to-end threat analysis process.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SOC architecture and workflows using a multi-system, real-world security stack
- Proficiency in deploying, configuring, and operating the Elastic Stack (Elastic and Kibana) for log ingestion, alerting, and threat monitoring
- Ability to integrate SIEM alerts with ticketing systems such as osTicket to support incident tracking and analyst workflows
- Enhanced knowledge of cloud computing concepts, including virtual private cloud (VPC) networking, segmented server deployment, and secure inter-service communication
- Experience generating and analyzing attack telemetry using adversary systems to simulate real-world threat scenarios
- Strengthened problem-solving and analytical skills through troubleshooting distributed systems, alert pipelines, and cloud-based service issues

### Tools Used
- Elastic: SIEM and log ingestion
- Logstash: Pipeline collecting telemetry from multiple sources
- Kibana: Log visualization, dashboards, and alerting
- osTicket: Incident tracking and case management
- Kali Linux: Attacker simulation and threat generation
- Vultr: Cloud hosting and VPC-based server infrastructure

## Steps

### 1. Created plan for overall structure of the project
